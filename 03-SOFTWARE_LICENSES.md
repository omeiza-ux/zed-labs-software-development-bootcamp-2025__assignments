# SOFTWARE LICENSES
A software license is a legal agreement that defines how a user or organization can install, use, modify, or distribute a piece of software.

1. MIT License

- A very permissive license.

- Allows users to freely use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and sell the software.

- Requires that the original license and copyright notice remain in all copies.

2. GNU General Public License (GPL)

- A copyleft license.

- Users can freely use, modify, and distribute the software, but derivative works must also be licensed under GPL.

- Ensures that software remains free and open-source.

3. Apache License 2.0

- Similar to MIT but more detailed.

- Allows modification, distribution, and use (commercial or private).

- Provides explicit grant of patent rights to users.

4. BSD License (Berkeley Software Distribution)

- Permissive, like MIT.

- Comes in variations (2-clause, 3-clause).

- Allows redistribution and use, but with minimal restrictions.

- Often used in academic and research projects.

5. Mozilla Public License (MPL)

- A file-level copyleft license.

- You can combine MPL code with proprietary code, but modifications to MPL-licensed files must remain open-source.

6. Creative Commons (CC) Licenses

- (While mostly for creative works, some software/documentation projects use them)

- Types include CC-BY (attribution), CC-BY-SA (share alike), CC-BY-NC (non-commercial).

- Allow varying degrees of freedom depending on chosen variant.
